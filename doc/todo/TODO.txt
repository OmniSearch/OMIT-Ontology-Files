Ontology Fixes:
1)
I found another error in NCRO Table 4 (now Table 3):
 
Line 1, Range: miRNA_gene_family_group -> miRNA_gene_family
 
Please add an entry to your to-do-list:
In the ncro ontology, “is_classified_into_gene_family_group” needs to be changed to “is_classified_into_gene_family”

2)
Add Usage/Relations in ontologies:
There are several relations that are non existent between terms in the ncro.owl file. 
I download the ncro.owl file from GitHub as well, just to make sure that I had the latest version. 
I don’t know if the relations are defined in other OWL files and just not showing up when imported. 
I would think that these relations would still be present in the ontology.

For example, there are no ‘occurs in’ relations in the ontology, yet these are in the diagram:
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ GO:cell
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ GO:cell line
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ NCRO:animal_study_model 
CL:cell ‘occurs in’ PRO:protein
+ 3 more

There are 4 ‘participates in’ relations in the diagram that are missing from NCRO.
The ‘part of’ is used several time in the diagram but is not used in NCRO at all.

3)
Change "BFO:has part" to "RO:has part".

4)
Create issue for missing miRNA labels for NCRO.

5)
Clean up data (remove duplicated predictions, get correct gene ids).



Software Fixes:
1)
Add comments to source code.

2)
Implement "Predicted by all databases" radio button feature.

3)
Add total number to non-MeSH-filtered gene names in "Publications" column.
