Ontology Fixes:
1)
Clean up data (remove duplicated predictions, get correct gene ids).

NCRO Fixes:
1)
In the ncro ontology, “is_classified_into_gene_family_group” needs to be changed to “is_classified_into_gene_family”

2)
Add Usage/Relations in ontologies:
There are several relations that are non existent between terms in the ncro.owl file. 
I download the ncro.owl file from GitHub as well, just to make sure that I had the latest version. 
I don’t know if the relations are defined in other OWL files and just not showing up when imported. 
I would think that these relations would still be present in the ontology.

For example, there are no ‘occurs in’ relations in the ontology, yet these are in the diagram:
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ GO:cell
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ GO:cell line
GO:transcription ‘occurs in’ NCRO:animal_study_model 
CL:cell ‘occurs in’ PRO:protein
+ 3 more

There are 4 ‘participates in’ relations in the diagram that are missing from NCRO.
The ‘part of’ is used several time in the diagram but is not used in NCRO at all.

To add usage for a relation, go to the "Domain" class of this relation, then add a subclass (using the "Object restriction" type and choosing the "Range" class of the aforementioned realtion).

3)
Change "BFO:has part" to "RO:has part".

Software Fixes:
1)
Add more pubmed data to the OmniStore
A subset of PubMed Ids related to the following MeSH Terms have been added to the OmniStore:
Adipogenesis
Anoikis
Autophagy
Carcinogenesis
Cell Adhesion
Cell cycle
Cell Differentiation
Cell Polarity
Cell Proliferation
Circulating
Cytokinesis
DNA break
DNA damage
DNA methylation
DNA repair
Endocytosis
Glycolysis
Infiltration
Invasiveness
Metastasis
Methylation
Mitosis
Mutagenesis
Mutation
Necrosis
Oxygen Consumption
Recurrence
Regression
Ubiquitylation

2)
Add total number to non-MeSH-filtered gene names in "Publications" column.

3)
The microRNA.org data contains scores that are negative and in decimal format.
Determine what these scores represent and if necessary, convert them to a percentage
in order to match the mirDB.org and targetscan.org data.


Completed:
1)
Add comments to source code.

2)
Modified pubmed.owl data to now include the MeSH_Term IRI rather than a MeSH_Term string
in order to speed up search time. The SPARQL query was modified in order to reflect these changes.

For example:
Before:
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="&obo;OMIT_1228026">

	<rdf:type rdf:resource="&obo;OMIT_0000003"/>

	<obo:BFO_00000150 rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">Drug resistance</obo:OMIT_0000150>

	<obo:OMIT_0000151 rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">23520479</obo:OMIT_0000151>

	<obo:RO_0000057 rdf:resource="&obo;OMIT_0016171"/>

</owl:NamedIndividual>


After:
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="&obo;OMIT_1228026">

	<rdf:type rdf:resource="&obo;OMIT_0000003"/>

	<obo:BFO_0000051 rdf:resource="&obo;OMIT_0000072"/>
 /** BFO_0000051 => "has part",  OMIT_0000072 => "Drug resistance" **/
	<obo:OMIT_0000151 rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">23520479</obo:OMIT_0000151>

	<obo:RO_0000057 rdf:resource="&obo;OMIT_0016171"/>

</owl:NamedIndividual>

3)
Add (0) to publications that contain no Publication Links
Remove link from Publications column when the count is 0

4)
Change "Evidence" to "Evidence Filter"

5)
hsa-miR-125b-5p
TargetGene		# of PubMed Papers Total			# of PubMed Papers after filtering "Drug Resistance"		% of reduced number
IRF4			130

6)
[The following issue was raised by one domain expert.]
It would be better if the user has three options:
1. Show all predicted genes.
2. Only show the genes that have MeSH-term filtered publications. 
3. Only show the genes that do not have MeSH-term filtered publications.

7)
Implement "Predicted by all databases" radio button feature.

8)
Create an issue for missing miRNA labels for NCRO.
